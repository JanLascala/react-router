                                Daria was an animated TV show that aired on MTV from 1997 to 2002. A spin-off of Beavis and Butt-Head, it followed the sharp-witted, sarcastic Daria Morgendorffer as she navigated high school life in the fictional town of Lawndale. With its dry humor, social satire, and smart, cynical protagonist, Daria became a cult classic, offering a sharp critique of teenage life, pop culture, and suburban society. The show stood out for its intelligent writing, strong female lead, and themes of individuality and skepticism.
